# Hackathon1.0
## Problem Statements
 
You need to use existing FOSS to provide solution. Any new solution from scratch (not based on existing FOSS) should need a justification. All work will have Open Source License (to be decided by Organisers) and all the code needed to be on some public version control system. Every  team needs to post their progress every hour.

Problem might be big and small. Your total achievement / contribution will be considered. If you are able to solve one problem, you may take a second one. If you are working on a big project,  your milestones will be considered. So, better define your small goals, from a big project.

Background material is only suggestive, you may search for better or similar FOSS alternatives. Before use of any such software, teams need to ensure that license of that software meets the requirements of Hackathon1.0

All demonstration shall be on Linux Server provided by college.
